        <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am a programmer interested in developing code to facilitate work in data analysis. I have worked many years in the oil & gas industry in exploration and new ventures. As I have worked in many basins, countries and companies, I have a clear knowledge of the workflow and the techniques used to understand the geology and reduce the risk in hydrocarbon exploration. My programming skills were initially devoted on solving challenges and uncerainties during oil & gas exploration. At the moment, I am more interested in developing code and solutions for various business problems in multiple industries.
            </p>
